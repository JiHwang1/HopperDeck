A typical workflow is to choose objects from PRIMITIVES, combine them using e.g. Boolean operations from COMBINATIONS, add further MODIFICATIONS as necessary and finally visualize the distance object using a component from the MESHING tab. Furthermore, there are different kinds of LATTICES, some MATH functions, components to convert Rhino GEOMETRY into an SDF and some utilities to ANALYSE the SDF.",

It is geared specifically toward wrapping existing geometric elements, and works with combinations of points, breps and curves, allowing users to vary a number of parameters that enhance sculptural potentials. It is still rough (and there are definitely a number of other approaches to level sets and isosurfacing that are faster, more robust, more elegant, and/or have more potential) but due to time constraints related to other work I am doing – now and into the near future – I thought it effective and fun enough that it was worth it to make this available to the community. As such, though, general caveats apply: it’s probably easy to break, and it will definitely generate some artifacts. But please download and have a play, and feedback on the grasshopper forum is welcome. There’s a longer description after the break.",

It provides multiple ways to wrap points, curves, and meshes as a volumetric data type, allowing you to then perform various operations on those volumes. Dendro includes components for boolean, smoothing, offsets, and morphing operations. \n\nWhen working with meshes or Breps, these types of operations are often computationally heavy, prone to failures, or cannot handle complex geometry. OpenVDB's volume data structures allow for quicker computation with higher repeatability, enabling you to leverage more complex operations within Grasshopper. \n\nThe goal was to make Dendro integrate into Grasshopper as seamlessly as possible. Whereas many voxel solutions require you to think of geometry as living with a bounding box, Dendro makes working with volumes no different than handling any other geometry in Grasshopper. Dendro works with many native Grasshopper components, avoiding the 'blocking' found in other plugins, and allowing you to move in and out of volume operations very quickly.",

Various DSE components allow the user to sample a parametric design space made from sliders, automatically iterate and capture images and numerical properties, reconstruct previous designs, cluster designs into families, analyze the importance of design variables, approximate computationally-intensive performance evaluations, and find Pareto fronts for multi-objective problems.   Although the components are intended to link together for simple, automated workflows for performance-based design of buildings and other structures, they can be used for any applications that require these functionalities within Grasshopper.",

This data can be used for analysis, but also for referencing objects back into Grasshopper, based on one or more filters defined by key-value pairs that were defined upon baking, or that were added to the geometry with the \"modify Rhino attributes\" component.

This duplicate is made available through a standard Grasshopper parameter output. The input of the component includes some custom programming to escape Grasshopper's recursive loop avoidance check. What this means in practice is that it is possible through the use of HoopSnake to send the output of a set of components back to it's input in a looping fashion. With the help of a little bit of Data Tree / Data List manipulation, this should open up some new possibilities for iterative process modeling.",

At every intermediate step the network is in static equilibrium (interim when interim forces are still present, or global when no interim forces exist).",

By using the Wave Function Collapse algorithm, it provides an innovative and fast solution to the emerging architectural problem of Discrete aggregation for purposes of design, architecture and urban planning.\n\nMonoceros is an implementation of the Wave Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm developed for game design by Maxim Gumin and extended and promoted by Oskar Stålberg with his game Townscaper. WFC is an algorithm that fills an entire spatial envelope with Modules in a meaningful way. The envelope is divided into discrete box-like Slots. The algorithm selects and places Modules into the Slots, making sure any two placed Modules can become neighbors (do have a common connector) according to specified Rules.\n\nDiscrete aggregation is one of the hottest approaches of computational design, along with the emergent swarm intelligence and AI. It recognizes small distinct parts that can be assembled into larger aggregates according to certain requirements. The parts are often represented by material components assembled using connectors. Most prominent discrete approaches are voxelization, discrete growth and constraint modeling, such as Wave Function Collapse.",

Therefore, a Rhino artist or designer does not have to leave their familiar Rhino environment anymore to make use of CityEngine’s procedural modeling power. Complicated export-import steps are no longer needed, which also means that the procedural models do not need to be “baked” anymore. The building or street models stay procedural during the entire design or planning workflow. Consequently, the user can change any attributes of the building or street models easily by connecting them to other Grasshopper components.\n\nPuma requires Rule Packages (RPK) as input, which are authored in CityEngine. An RPK includes assets and a CGA rule file which encodes an architectural style. Comprehensive RPK examples are available below and can be used “out-of-the-box” in Puma. More examples for CGA rule files can additionally be found in the CityEngine tutorials.\n\nPuma is well suited for managing the procedural generation of architectural 3D content in design and urban planning scenarios. However, Puma is restricted to the procedural generation of buildings and street detailing/furniture. Puma does not include the city layout and street network editing tools of CityEngine (i.e. the rich CityEngine toolset to design a city from scratch or based on geographic data is still needed).",

This is made possible due to the speed increases afforded by the use of the point cloud class. For example, a full point cloud from a Kinect V2 is released in approximately 10-20ms on standard machines, which is more than enough for most purposes.

Topologic is designed as a core library and additional plugins to visual data flow programming (VDFP) applications and parametric modelling platforms commonly used in architectural design practice. These applications provide workspaces with visual programming nodes and connections for architects to interact with Topologic and perform architectural design and analysis tasks.\n\nTopologic is well-suited to create a lightweight representation of a building as an external envelope and the subdivision of the enclosed space into separate spaces and zones using zero-thickness internal surfaces. Because Topologic maintains topological consistency, a user can query these cellular spaces and surfaces regarding their topological data and thus conduct various analyses. For example, this lightweight and consistent representation was found to be well-matched with the input data requirements for energy analysis simulation software. Because Topologic allows entities with mixed dimensionalities and those that are optionally independent (e.g. a line, a surface, a volume) to co-exist, structural models can be represented in a coherent manner where lines can represent columns and beams, surfaces can represent walls and slabs, and volumes can represent solids. In addition, non-building entities, such as structural loads can be efficiently attached to the structure. This creates a lightweight model that is well-matched with the input data requirements for structural analysis simulation software.",

Often the problem is that the resulting curves overlap. Tweener solves that problem. \n\nThis Grasshopper/Rhino plugin generates curves that interpolate between: - either any number of closed planar curves, one of which is the outer one and emcompasses all others (This part of Tweener is called the \"planar Tweener\" even though there are also functions for extruding the curves to 3D), or between:  - two arbitrary, not necessarily closed input curves, on any constraint surface given by an input surface brep or surface mesh. \n\nThe resulting output curves are guaranteed not to cross each other or the input curves, no matter how complex your input is. Moreover, they are guaranteed to be smooth and parametrization-independent. The output is either the curves, or a mesh textured according to the tween gradient. Tweener curves are manipulated by their input curves, just the way usual curves are manipulated by their control points. Thus, Tweener can be thought of as introducing another modeling paradigm for curves.\n\nBoth the in-built Rhino and Grasshopper tweeners as well as a certain popular Grasshopper plugin don't leave the control-point paradigm for generating tween curves. As a result, the tween curves start to overlap quickly, as soon as the input becomes somewhat complex. In contrast, this package provides a tweening functionality whose emphasis on the mere curves' shapes is entirely independent on how the curve is controlled or parametrized. \n\nSince the tween curves don't cut each other or the input curves, Tweener lends itself specifically to applications such as general illustration, typography, 3d printing, layer design, CNC, landscape architecture etc - typically in landscapes, you don't want overhanging cliffs; likewise, a concrete printer usually has difficulties with excessive overhangs. There is a TweenerTopo component that allows to extrude planar tween curves to 3D in order to generate quality landscape isolines, allowing the user to provide an additional \"shape\" parameter that controls the convexity/concavity of the landscape.\n\nApart from landscape design, the planar Tweener lends itself for interior design where smooth guard curves steer people along the design language of your given interior - think Ikea, or think of the space between facade and core of a high-rise building.\n\nTweener is not limited to planar curves or simple extrusions of planar curves: it can tween between any two arbitrary, not necessarily closed curves, if there is a constraint surface as additional input. Tweener pulls the input curves back to the constraint surface and then generates curves between them, on the surface. Again, overlaps are guaranteed not to occur.\n\nMoreover, there is a powerful interactive TweenCurve editing environment that can be reached from the Rhino command line, including a \"Fish Eye effect\", and a way to drag the curves without disrupting the aesthetic and visual quality! Please watch the \"monkey face\" video on food4rhino to see what it does, and type \"TweenStartExample\" command to start an example editing environment.",

The description of each individual part includes basic information necessary for the aggregation process (part geometry, connections location and orientation). The set of connections define the topological graph of the part, which is then used to define the possibilities of aggregation with other parts.\n\nThe core of the framework relies on a set of aggregation procedures, allowing generation of specific structures from the combination of different modules. Each of these procedures is composed of strategies for the selection of basic aggregation rules, described as an instruction to orient one module over a selected connection of another module. Currently available procedures include stochastic aggregation and field-driven aggregation.",
